## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

This demo includes Razorpay key secret in frontend for demonstration purposes only. 

**In production:**
- NEVER expose `key_secret` in frontend code
- Order creation must be done on backend server
- Payment verification must be done on backend server
- Use webhooks for payment status updates

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Razorpay Configuration
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

# WARNING: In production, key_secret should NOT be in frontend environment
```

### 2. Production Backend Requirements

For production deployment, implement these endpoints on your backend:

```javascript
// Backend endpoint to create Razorpay order
POST /api/create-order
{
  "amount": 19900,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "ticket_1234567890"
}

// Backend endpoint to verify payment
POST /api/verify-payment
{
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_xxxxx",
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_xxxxx", 
  "razorpay_signature": "signature_xxxxx"
}
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```
